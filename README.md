- Support for multiple routing algorithms:
    - Dijkstra's Algorithm
    - A* Algorithm
- Real-time journey calculations considering:
    - Multiple tarnsport types
    - Walking distances
    - Transit times

### 2. Heatmap Visualization
- Visual representation of transit accessibility
- Color-coded areas showing
    - Travel time zones
    - Transport coverage
- Support for multiple heatmap algorithms:
    - Dijkstra's Algorithm
    - A* Algorithm
- Interactive map interface

### 3. User Interface
- Interactive map with zoom and dragging functionality
- Waypoint selection for start/end locations
- Real-time weather information display
- Clean, intuitive interface with:
    - Main menu navigation
    - Algorithm selection
    - Results visualization

### Key classes
- `RoutingEngine`: Core routing logic
- `WindowManager`: UI coordination
- `MapComponent`: Map visualization
- `DirectionsWindow`: Route planning interface
- `HeatMapWindow`: Heatmap visualization

## Data Sources üìä

- Helsinki Regional Transport (HSL) GTFS data
- OpenStreetMap for base map visualization

## Usage Guide üìù

1. Launch the application
2. Choose between "Plan a journey" or "Heatmap" mode
3. Select your preferred algorithm 
4. For journey planning:
    - Click to set start and end points
    - View route suggestion
5. For heatmap view:
    - Select a start point
    - View accessibility visualization

## Special Thanks ü§ù

This project was developed as part of the Computer Science Bachelor at Maastricht University, The Netherlands. Special thanks to my group teammates with which we worked collaboratively to deliver this comprehensive route planning solution, combining our diverse skills in software development, algorithmic thinking, and user experience design.
